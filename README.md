# Steve Grunwell's Dotfiles

Just another dotfiles repository. There are many like it, but these are mine. There are also probably many that use that expression. #DealWithIt

Major kudos to [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) for the inspiration and some of the snippets.

## Installation

Clone the repository wherever you'd like, then run `sh install.sh` to run the installation script (which just symlinks the files that don't already exist into your home directory). I keep the repo in ~/dotfiles, but that's just personal preference.
